    <h3>What is a graph database?</h3>
    Uses graph structure to store data, in the form of nodes, edges, and properties<br>
    Underlying structures vary between databases<br>
    Much like relational databases, graph databases rely on a query language (e.g. Cypher) to look up information<br>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Why use them at all?</h3>
    Significantly more efficient querying process<br>
    Links and properties thereof are stored logically within the database<br>
    
    <h3>Graph Database Basics</h3>
    Data is stored in three major types of containers: nodes, edges, and properties<br>
    
    <h3>Nodes</h3>
    Nodes represent “things” or “entities,” such as people, actors, movies, etc.<br>
    Used to store all information about the entity, much like a row of data in SQLite<br>
    Represented by colorful balls<br>
    
    <h3>Edges</h3>
    Edges represent relationships between nodes<br>
    The direction of an edge denotes how nodes relate to one another<br>
    There can be multiple edges between nodes<br>
    
    <h3>Properties</h3>
    Properties are key-value pairs that encompass the information or attributes assigned to nodes and edges<br>
    <br>
    In nodes: these can be basic characteristics<br>
    In edges: these describe the nature of the relationship (e.g. Uber ratings)<br>
    
    <h3>Different Graph Databases and Query Languages</h3>
    Notable databases: GraphDB, ArangoDB, Neo4j, DataStax<br>
    Notable query languages: Cypher, Gremlin, SPARQL<br>
    These languages are standardized among numerous databases, and are imperative for data lookup<br>
