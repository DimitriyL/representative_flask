    <h3>Alternate Ways to View Data</h3>
    In the browser, one can view the data in four different ways: Graph, Table,  Text, and Code<br>

    <h3>Implementing Cypher Through Drivers</h3>
    In order to create and update graph databases, a developed can use drivers<br>
    In Neo4j, there are drivers for Java, JavaScript, Python, and .NET<br>
    To begin, install the driver (for Python, use pip):<br>
    <br>
    Then, running the Python driver is very similar to using Python for SQLite…<br>
    … Import necessary libraries, then use Strings to query<br>

    <h3>Open-Source Examples</h3>
    The movie example that I used is readily available in the browser as soon as you open it<br>
    However, for examples of the same movie database example, created using a driver, use the plentiful repositories on the “Neo4j Examples” GitHub:<br>
